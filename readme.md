Deploy a High-Availability Web App using CloudFormation

In this project (Udagram App), I deployed web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. I wrote the script that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an Udagram app from the ground up. The script begin deploying the networking components followed by servers, security roles and software.

*In this project i used a bastion host in order to connect to the instances (for troubleshooting) in the private subnet , 
for that i used SSH agent forwarding , which allows me to connect from the bastion to the other instances 
without storing the private key on the bastion which is a very bad practice . 
The SSH agent is a program that keeps track of the user identity keys .For the deployement part  ,please find config file
